# Infix-Posfix-Example
Basic infix to postfix convert and calculation
This project was prepared to remind me of this issue in the future.
The LinkedStack class makes use of the Node class for conversion.
MyStack class uses the MyObject class.
The algorithm can easily convert the infix expression to the 
postfix expression, but the computation function only returns the result of the one-step expressions.
